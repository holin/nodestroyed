Nodestroyed
===========

Nodestroyed is a rails plugin which similar with acts_as_indestructible(https://github.com/ryanlowe/acts_as_indestructible/tree), it only adds a destroyed column to model and sets its value to false instead of destroyed the record permanently.


Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  act_as_nodestroyed
  ...
end
